The project of Genshin Impact had been developed as early as late January 2017, with an initial team of 120 people, which grew to 400 by the end of that year, and reached 700 by February 2021. The game had a development and marketing budget of around $100 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop. Between the announcement and release closed beta tests were held, allowing invited players to explore and interact with the open world. The game includes voice-overs in four languages, and 13 different languages for text.
